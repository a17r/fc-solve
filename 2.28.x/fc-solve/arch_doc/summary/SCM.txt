Game Presets Configuration:
---------------------------

The info for generating the game presets lie in the file gen_presets.pl. It
uses data structure inheritance to determine the exact parameters to be 
included in each preset. Its output should later be incorporated into presets.c

Maintaining a list of Modules:
------------------------------

The file gen_makefile.pl maintains a list of modules and headers across
all makefiles that are distributed as part of Freecell Solver. 

Generating the site:
--------------------

The site lies in the sub-directory of fc-solve/site/wml in the CVS and is 
generated using GNU Make, WebMetaLanguage and CVS glue. If a development
version is present, it is checked out of the CVS, packed into an archive,
and placed on the site with a link in the downloads page.

Both the vipe.technion.ac.il main site and BerliOS mirror are generated from
the same makefile and both are uploaded to their places using rsync.

The site generation process also generates a zip archive of the latest stable
version so it can be used to automatically compile the Win32 binary.

freecell-solver-config:
-----------------------

The autoconf process creates a freecell-solver-config program that can be
used as an aid in programs wishing to compile and link against Freecell 
Solver. It is generated from freecell-solver-config.in by the configure
script and is installed system-wide.

The Win32 Binary:
-----------------

The Win32 binary is compiled by a batch file placed on the site and found in
the CVS in the directory:

http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fc-solve/fc-solve/site/wml/src/win32_build/bootstrap/build.bat

This script should be placed on a Windows NT 4.0 and above computer that has
the Microsoft Visual Studio environment installed. It should be placed in
a directory containing only it and the curl.exe executable from the same
location.

http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/win32_build/

What it does is the following:

1. Download zip.exe and unzip.exe from the static sub-dir.
2. Download fcs.zip from the dynamic sub-dir.
3. Unpack fcs.zip.
4. Determine its version number and record it in a variable.
5. Compile Freecell Solver.
6. Place the relevant files in a directory structure by copying them.
7. Create a zip archive of them.
