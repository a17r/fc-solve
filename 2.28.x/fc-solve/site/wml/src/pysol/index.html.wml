<latemp_subject "Freecell Solver PySol Integration"  />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is code that enables Freecell Solver integration with 
<a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol/">PySol</a>,
an excellent cross-platform Solitaire Suite written in Python.

Python bindings for Freecell Solver. Can be built as an RPM. Requires 
Freecell Solver.

Patch for PySol 4.82 to enable Freecell Solver integration. PySol will use
Freecell Solver only if the Python bindings are installed.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
I assume you already have Python, PySol and all of their
requisites installed. First, install Freecell Solver. Afterwards compile
the Python bindings for it. Afterwards download the PySol source from
<a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol/">its homepage</a>,
apply the patch, and invoke pysol from that directory.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
The current integration still leaves a lot to be desired. I haven't yet
enabled the use of Freecell Solver for Der Katzenschwanz and Die Schlange
, as well as all the pseudo-Freecell games like Cruel, Good Measure, 
or Streets and Alleys. The latter may require translating moves
to single-card moves, as Freecell Solver may move the cards one sequence at
a time. Plus, Simple Simon cannot work because Freecell Solver also moves
non-homogenous sequences as one, so it was not enabled at the moment.
