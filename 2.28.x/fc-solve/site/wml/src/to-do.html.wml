<latemp_subject "Freecell Solver's Future Directions" />

<p>
While Freecell Solver is a fairly usable package that satisfies the needs of 
a large part of the users, it is by no means complete. This page hopes to
address some of the long-term, primary issues in which I'd like to enhance it 
in the future. It is based on the <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/TODO?view=log">TODO</a> file, but is more elaborated and
detailed.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is possible to work on Freecell Solver if 
<a href="getting-credit.html">you would like to give or get academic 
credit</a>.

<h2 id="future-tasks">Tasks to be Considered in the Future</h2>

<h3 id="patsolve_logic">Derived State Ordering and Incorporating Patsolve's 
Logic</h3>

<p>
From any given position Freecell Solver reaches it uses some functions called
tests to generate a list of subsequent positions that can be reached from it.
Each test corresponds to one move type, and they output the derived states in
the order they found them. FCS groups the lists into test groups, and then
either try them one by one, or randomizes them.
</p>

<p>
What can be done, is to order the derived states based on some parameters, other
than simply randomizing them. Currently there is a code for a state 
prioritization that is used in the best-first-search code. Aside for that, there
is also the prioritization <a href="http://members.tripod.com/professor_tom/">Tom Holroyd</a> 
implemented for Patsolve. What I would like to have for the next release, is a 
generic way to order derived positions, implementing all of the random, mine, 
and Tom's back-ends, and an ability to implement more in the future.
</p>

<h3 id="state_lookups">State Lookups</h3>

<p>
Currently, in order to find a suitable meta-move, Freecell Solver performs
a large number of nested loops, each searching all the columns or 
freecells for suitable cards or card combinations. However, it is possible
that one can speed up such queries by "compiling" the state and forming a
lookup table, that will allow the elimination of some loops. 
</p>

<p>
A prospective volunteer for implementing this should study the code and
see where such lookups can be made, implement the state compilation (once for
each inspected state), and convert the code to using them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This was implemented to a very limited extent in only one
of the "test" functions in <tt>freecell.c</tt>. It should be implemented
in other test functions as well, while possibly extending the scope.
</p>

<h3 id="orig_calc_states">States Calculated from the Original</h3>

<p>
In the variants of Solitaire supported by Freecell Solver, during the game,
each column has a few of the cards from the start of the game, followed
by a sequence of cards that decrease in rank. Thus, we can simply store:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The number of original cards. 0-104 for two deck games - we need 7 bits for 
that. (8-bits for parity)
</li>
<li>
The number of cards in the sequence. 0-12 - we need 4 bits for that.
</li>
<li>
For each of the cards in the sequence we need to store their suit. That is
0-3 which is 2-bits.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since we can determine the number of suit units from the number of cards in the
sequence, we can store them after the column header, and thus store the
column headers compactly. For a typical game we need 12 bits*$NUM_COLUMNS plus 
at most 2 bits * 52 * $NUM_DECKS. For Freecell, that would make it 
12*8+2*52 == 200 bits, which is 25 bytes. Or less in many cases.
</p>

<p>
In comparison, the "Indirect Stacks" allocation (which is the most compact
one implemented yet) takes 4-bytes for each column on a 32-bit 
machine, which makes it 32 bytes, plus more to store the cards in the columns.
This becomes worse on 64-bit computers.
</p>

<p>
While this (the calculated from original) representation is not suitable
for inspecting the state, in order to calculate the derived moves from it,
it would be suitable for storing the state in the states collection. Thus,
we will have to convert to and from that representation.
</p>

<p>
This suggested feature was inspired by a similar technique used by
<a href="don_woods.html">Don Woods' solver</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="multi_threading">Multi-Threading</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver can run several scans on the same states collection. However, 
it can only run a certain scan for a given number of iterations, suspend it 
with purely high-level mechanisms, and then run a different scan instead. Later
on, the original scan can be resumed. However, it is still not possible to
run two scans on the same state collection in two different threads 
simultaneously without risking the integrity of the data and the program 
as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The codebase foundation for thread-enabling is already in the code, based on 
the distinction between soft-threads that encompass a single scan, and 
hard-threads - a collection of soft-threads that share some resources. Every
hard-thread can run only one of its soft-thread at the time, but several 
hard-threads would be able to run simultaneously, assuming suitable locking 
locking mechanisms are in place.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/377">scheme
for Mulit-threading Freecell Solver</a> was proposed by Shlomi Fish, but the
actual implementation of the locking was not implemented yet. To do so, one
should write an abstraction of threading and locking mechanisms 
(<tt>fc_solve_thread_*</tt>), which will either default to doing nothing,
or to running the appropriate threading functions of any threading API (be
it POSIX threads, the Win32 API, APR or whatever). 
</p>

<p>
Making Freecell Solver thread-enabled is not high on my agenda, because few
users have multi-processor machines that can somehow benefit from this scheme.
Those with uni-processor machines are better off using several soft-threads
within a single hard-thread that are arbitrated by the program.  
</p>

<h3 id="java">Porting to Java</h3>

<p>
Imagine being able to browse to a web-site which will present you with
a Java applet implementing Freecell with a built-in solver. At the moment
Freecell Solver is written in ANSI C, and requires compilation or downloading
a binary or a program that integrates it. If it is converted to Java, however,
it can be deployed on most modern Internet-connected systems without the
need for pre-installation.
</p>

<p>
Writing an equivalent Java version (perhaps without some of the specific ANSI
C optimizations that Freecell Solver has), would be a very cool thing. I did 
not get to do it yet, because I keep having new ideas for improving the C 
versions. Note that as far as the graphical user-interface is concerned, there
should not be too much problem, because there's already <a href="http://javaboutique.internet.com/JSolitaire/">an open-source 
    Solitaire Suite written in Java</a>, with Freecell and many other games.
</p>

<p>
Note that <a href="http://ivm.sourceforge.net/">Internet C++</a> assuming
it becomes popular, may eventually eliminate the need for it, since the C 
compiler gcc can compile code to it virtual machine . However, at the moment, 
Java is the de-facto technology for making programs run inside a browser.
</p>

<h3 id="failed_allocs">Safety from Failed Memory Allocations</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver uses many calls to the memory allocations, but does not check
that they return a valid buffer pointer. Should the memory run out, and they 
fail, it can easily cause the entire process running it to crash.
</p>

<p>
What needs to be implemented is a way to check if <tt>malloc()</tt> and
<tt>realloc</tt> calls returned NULL, and if so, free all other allocated
memory and propagate the memory upward to the calling functions. There
are several ways in which it can be achieved. One would be by defining an 
exception class, much like that of Java only passed as one of the function 
parameters and handled explicitly in each function. Another option would be 
to keep all malloced pointers inside an Apache Portable Runtime-like 
memory pool and to explicitly free it should an allocation failed.
</p>

<p>
This will involve a great deal of extra code and complexity, but will make 
Freecell Solver more secure and fail-proof.
</p>

<h3 id="rcs_state_storage">RCS-like State Storage</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Configuration_Management/Tools/Revision_Control_System/">RCS</a> 
is short for Revision Control System, and is an early version control system
for UNIX computers, that is still in use today. (either directly or 
indirectly). RCS works by storing the original file, and then storing the 
differences from the original to its subsequent versions, and from each 
subsequent versions to its subsequent versions etc. To extract a file of 
version X, it starts from the original version and applies patches 
0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;2 until X-1 -&gt; X.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://nadav.harel.org.il/">Nadav Har'El</a> suggested that instead
of storing the entire state in memory, Freecell Solver will only store the moves
leading to this state from its predecessor. That way, a lot of memory will
be conserved, and FCS may even run faster. Freecell Solver already stores the
moves to the parent states, because they are required to output the solution
as a sequence of individual moves. However, it still requires the bulk board 
layout to distinguish between similar states.
</p>

<p>
Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to tweak the code, so it would
be possible to remove the board layouts themselves and get by with the moves
alone. Note that the code at the moment, is completely unsuitable for this,
and would have to be re-vamped. Also note that I believe one would still need 
to have a cache of the recently encountered states, to make sure the solver
does not spend too much time constructing states from scratch.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is a relatively speculative feature, which I only want to 
implement to see how well it run.
</p>

<h3 id="client_server_multi_tasking">A Client/Server Multi-tasking Architecture</h3>

<p>
Yet another speculative feature that was inspired by a talk I had with 
Dave Goehrig in which he claimed multi-processing in Linux was more efficient
than multi-threading. (a claim I saw elsewhere). I believe the Game AI model
gives way to multi-threading better because all scans operating on the 
same states collection need access to all the states present in it. However,
it is posssible that a multi-processed model will still work better.
</p>

<p>
What would be done is that the parent process (the server) will hold the 
entire state collection and will spawn children process which each will 
take the responsibility of running a hard thread. The hard threads will
query the parent process (through some Inter-Process Communication mechanism, 
probably an anonymous pipe) about the presence of states there. The server
process will answer the queries one by one and will add relevant states to the
client processes. Once one of them queries the empty state, it will terminate 
all the children processes, and reconstruct the graph from there.
</p>

<p>
This is much easier done on UNIXes or UNIX-like systems where multi-processing 
is much stronger than on Win32. (&lt;rant /&gt;) It also may be worthwhile for
each client process to hold a local cache of states, so it won't query the
server excessively.
</p>

<p>
Again, this is something I'm planning to do, after I implement multi-threading, if I do it at all.
</p>

<h3 id="generalising">Generalising Freecell Solver to non-card Games</h3>

<p>
This is a <b>very</b> pipe-dream goal. As some of you may be aware I already
wrote <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lm-solve/">LM-Solve</a> as
a solver for several types of Logic Mazes, which are another type of 
single-player games (which are much easier to solve using a computer). It is
written in Perl, but still runs quite quickly, but still largely incomplete.
It is also still a standalone program without a usable API.
</p>

<p>
Now, I also thought about writing a solver for the old DOS game StoneAge, and
generally there are other single-player card games for which Game AI heuristics 
are required to solve. Most of the logic of Freecell Solver is quite generic,
and I suppose may prove useful to other games. So, instead of having separate 
solver (in C, LISP, Perl, Python or whatever) for each one of these games, we
can have a unified solver with several game plug-ins. This would be cool, 
because it would mean hackers of single-player game AIs will not have to 
re-invent the wheel time and again; instead, they can only implement suitable
test functions, and prioritization functions for their own games, and still
enjoy the power that the Freecell Solver framework gives them.
</p>

<p>
Notice that my attempt at solving several talon-based games Solitaire Card
games like Klondike or Gypsy was not successful. That does not mean it can't be
done. Michael Mann was more successful with <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/michael_mann/">his 
    port of Freecell Solver</a>, and Stephan Kulow has an interesting heuristic 
for single-card-deal Klondike in kpat that can solve on average 50% of the 
games. (I don't think it is a back-tracking heuristic, though).
</p>

<h2 id="finale">Finale</h2>

<p>
If all or most of these changes take effect, Freecell Solver will become much
more "bloated" with features and enhancements than it already is today. Freecell
Solver has already turned, from a proof-of-concept solver I used to test if 
my initial idea on how to solve Freecell would work, to an architecture 
dedicated to solving Freecell and similar Solitaires. I think it satisfies the
needs of most users quite adequately. However, I think that enhancing it 
further is still a good idea, because it will make the code more modular and 
more maintainable, and would allow it to become a reference implementation or 
a base for similar projects with the needed subset of functionality.
</p>

<p>
Note that Freecell Solver was not the first computerized solver for Freecell to
be written. (one of the first was <a href="don_woods.html">the one by Don Woods'</a>, and Woods is very famous for many of his
other endeavours) It will also not the last that will be written (there is in 
fact an AI course in the University of Massachustes, given each year, in which 
the students are assigned to write a Freecell solver as one of their work 
assignments). I recommend reading Eric Raymond's 
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The 
Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> to understand why adding more features can 
still be a good idea. CatB discusses fetchmail which is still actively 
developed, despite the fact it will give anything most users will need and 
more. I don't see a reason to stop developing Freecell Solver just because it 
has reached a similar state. So people, hack on! (on Freecell Solver or 
something else)
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="completed">Completed Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="identifier_prefix">Shortening the Identifier Prefix</h3>

<p>
At the moment, the global Freecell Solver identifiers use the 
<tt>freecell_solver_</tt> prefix. However, this prefix is too long and
makes the code hard to read. Using the <tt>fcs_</tt> prefix wouldn't be
desirable either, because 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fcs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">we 
don't own the fcs</a> prefix. However 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fc+solve&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">fc-solve 
is ours</a> and as a result, we can use <tt>fc_solve_</tt> instead. Note that
for backwards compatibility, the Freecell Solver interface functions should
be named <tt>freecell_solver_user_</tt>. This is not an issue because they
are not used internally.
</p>

<h3 id="automated_test_suite">Writing an Automated Testing Framework</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver at the moment has very little if any automatic tests that were 
prepared to it. Testing it is done manually and relies on the developer's 
intuition and the users' feedback. So far, most stable x.y.0 releases were
followed by several minor version that fixed some things. (usually minor) 
Many of the tests performed are semi-automatic and just a matter of
keying the same command sequence over and over again. A unified automatic
testing framework may go a long way into ensuring the quality of the released
product and while not eliminating the need for an experienced developer/Q&amp;A
engineer, will make things easier in the long run.
</p>
    
<p>
There are several type of tests I have in mind:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    Regression Tests - making sure the output of various runs of Freecell 
    Solver is identical to runs of previous versions (by comparing MD5 
    checksums). The solving algorithm was known to change from release
    to release, but it is still expected to be the same unless explicitly
    modified. If it does, one can re-initialize the checksums.
    </li>
    <li>
    Unit Tests - making sure every module of Freecell Solver is not broken
    by explicitly testing its interface.
    </li>
    <li>
    Validity and Stability Tests - making sure various runs of Freecell
    Solver do not crash and produce valid output. (that can be verified by
    playing the solution, or analyzing the run-time trace). Also, making 
    sure that too virtually identical runs (differing only in insignificant
    parameters) produce identical results.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
For performing the test, you can use any tool that can be easily installed on
a GNU-based UNIX derivative. I would prefer if the tests were written in a
combination of C, Perl and Bash (or plain sh). Still, I will accept tests 
written in other languages or frameworks, because they are better than no 
tests at all, and can easily be re-implemented should the need arise.
</p>

<h3 id="scons">Converting the Install Procedure to SCons</h3>

<p>
At the moment, Freecell Solver uses 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Autotools/">GNU Autoconf,
Automake and Libtool</a> as its build and installation system. However, these
tools are incredibly idiosyncratic and painful to work with, and have
caused many problems in the past. A more modern and superior tool is 
<a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, and I had a pleasant experience
working with it on <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/">Latemp</a>.
</p>

<p>
I believe a switch of the Freecell Solver build system to SCons is in order.
The only thing that has to be done previously is to write a rudimentary 
regression test suite to check the output of several board solutions before and
after the switch. (Better safe than sorry.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Eventually it was decided to convert the Freecell Solver 
build-system to use <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> instead, and 
we are happy with this choice.
</p>

<h3 id="pysol_integration">PySol Integration</h3>

<p>
PySol by Markus Oberhumer is by far the most feature-rich and complete
open-source suite of card Solitaire games. PySol's has its own ad-hoc solving
mechanism for all of its supported variants, including those that are supported
by Freecell Solver. However, as far as the games supported by Freecell Solver
are concerned, it fairs much worse, often leading the player to incorrect
solutions.
</p>

<p>
PySol is written in Python, a high-level cross-platform language. 
Integrating Freecell Solver into PySol will require creating Python bindings 
for some of Freeecell Solver API (a large part of it can be encapsulated by
calls to its internal command line arguments-based configurator), and then
creating the appropriate interface within the core PySol code. 
</p>

<p>
As of January 2, 2003, PySol 4.81 is available on its site, and is ready
to run and stable. Markus mentions there that he is working on PySol5, which
would be based on wxPython, and include many improvements. Assuming you are
interested in integrating it, the choice is yours whether to patch
PySol 4.81 or wait for a beta of PySol 5.x to be released.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> <a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</a>, an enhanced
spin-off of PySol now has an extensive integrated support for solving using 
Freecell Solver for all of the variants that the latter supports. The
integration was done by calling the fc-solve command-line solver, and parsing
its output, which was not how I thought of doing it, but still is a good
way to achieve the integration. The original developer of PySol now recommends
PySolFC instead on the PySol homepage, and I've been happy with it too.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the PySolFC developers for making it happen.
</p>

<h3 id="cmd_line_prefix_tree">Command Line Prefix Tree Handling</h3>

<p>
At the moment, each flag in the command line is checked by comparing for
each of the command line options accepted by Freecell Solver, one after the 
other. This is sub-optimal because it is possible the relevant command line 
option will be looked up only at the end, and also because this long process
needs to be done for each option that was inputted on the command line.
</p>

<p>
To resolve it it would be a good idea to define the command line processing
by processing a prefix-tree of command line options, that once accepted will
result in a clause being evaluated. (Or if failed, will jump to a common
"unknown command line option" handling code.) This should be done by 
preprocessing the command line evaluation code using a Perl program written
for this purpose.
</p>
