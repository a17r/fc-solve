This is the source code for the famous Freecell solver by 
<a href="http://www.icynic.com/~don/">Don Woods</a>. It is basically 
4 different solvers for four different Freecell variants which are 
using a very similar algorithm. Maybe it is possible to abstract 
the game rules and integrate all of them into one solver.
