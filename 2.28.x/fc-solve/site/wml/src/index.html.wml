<p>
This is Freecell Solver - a program that automatically solves games of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell</a> and similar 
variants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire">Card 
Solitaire</a> such as Eight Off, Forecell and
Seahaven Towers, as well as Simple Simon boards. Freecell Solver is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">free 
and open source software</a> freely available under the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/X11 License</a>. 
It is written in ANSI C and requires a C compiler to be built.  Nevertheless, 
binaries for Microsoft Windows 32-bit are available.
</p>

<p>
Included with the archive is source code for programs that can automatically 
feed it with the boards of several popular Solitaire Implementations.
</p>

<p>
Freecell Solver can also be built as a library for use within your own
Solitaire implementations. A more detailed list of features can be found
in the <a href="features.html"><b>Features List</b></a>.
