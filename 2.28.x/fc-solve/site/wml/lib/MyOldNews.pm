Freecell Solver version 0.4 was released. This version contains three major

Freecell Solver version 0.6 was released. This version features a more 
modular code as well as the following usability features:
</p>

<ol>
<li>An extra movement that allows Freecell Solver to solve 
some boards which it could not solve previously.
</li>
<li>The order of the stacks and freecells is preserved 
throughout the solutions.
</li>
<li>Limit to a certain number of iterations (so it will stop before it consumes 
too much memory)</li>
<li>Specify the order of the movements that will be tested. Usually, a test 
order can be found that will solve a given board really fast.</li>

include:

<li>Some bug-fixes. (users of previous versions should upgrade)</li>

<li>Support for a variable number of freecells, stacks, and cards per stack.

<p>Freecell Solver version 1.0.0 was released. This version can solve more
game types, and can be compiled so it will be less memory intensive which is
especially good for such games as Die Schlange or Der Katzenschwantz.</p>

<p>Now there is also a library interface for use with games, which supports
suspending a solution process and resuming it from its last position. And
naturally, there is a bug fix or two, so you should upgrade. :-)</p>

rather version 1.x.y. Hoorah for the new initial digit!</p>

Version 1.2.0 of Freecell Solver is now available for download. This version
has several improved moves so it can solve more boards. It also sports a
more robust command-line argument handling so you can expect much less 
segfaults if you use it improperly.

The code has also changed quite a bit, so it may be of interest to
developers who are interested to look under its hood.

library-related), as well as an improved Soft-DFS scan, plus A* and BFS
scans. (which are experimental and do not always work properly).

Freecell Solver version 1.6.0 has been released. It supports a solution path
optimization routine which enables it to generate solutions that contain a 
smaller number of moves. Furthermore, there are some optimizations, so it 
should be at least a little faster.

Freecell Solver version 1.8.0 was released into the world. Its main
highlight is its new building process based on GNU Autotools. Now, one
can build a shared library, a static library and an executable across
many UNIX variants out of the box.

I also adapted the GNOME AisleRiot board generation program to generate
the boards of the new Solitaire variants that were added to it and are 
supported by Freecell Solver.

atomic moves, which are slower than the traditional ones, but guarantee 
a true verdict. It also has a <tt>--prelude</tt> switch that allows running
a static order of quotas at start for the participating soft threads, and
makes constructing faster solving presets easier.

Freecell Solver 2.14.0 was released today. This release features a major
speed boost, and an important bug fix: when "--sequence-move unlimited"
had been specified in previous versions, it sometimes did not take effect
due to other parameters, and as a result the sequence move was still limited.
(Thanks to larrysan for reporting this problem).
</p>

<p>
This release comes relatively shortly after the previous release, and without
any developer versions. This is in an effort to make more frequent stable
releases with notable features.

Freecell Solver 2.16.0 is now available. Culminating many person-years
of effort (OK - some person-days of effort), it is the best release todate.

The highlights of this release are a bug fix to the iteration numbers in
the "-s -i" display, and an internal refactoring of the
ptr_state_with_locations_t struct into a separate ptr_state_t (the key) and
a ptr_state_extra_info_t (the value). The latter should not affect the external
behaviour or API in any way.

This release (like previous ones) is available from 
<a href="download.html">the download page</a>. Next on our agenda is getting
a binary package for Microsoft Windows out-of-the-door, and more code cleanups,
optimisations and enhancements.
