How to benchmark a Freecell Solver Release:
-------------------------------------------

Requirements: perl-5.8.x or above, CMake, gcc, bash and a working 
pthreads-devel package.

1. Download the Freecell Solver .tar.bz2 archive from 
http://fc-solve.berlios.de/.

2. Unpack and cd to the freecell-solver-* directory.

3. Run "./Tatzer -l tt".

4. Type "make" to build everything.

5. Run "bash scripts/time-threads-num.bash $MAX_NUM_THREADS" . 

The default for $MAX_NUM_THREADS is 6, where 7 completely hogs my system. If 
you have many CPUs and/or cores and you are confident that raising it will 
not overload your system, you may try to raise it.

Running the benchmarking threads is better done when the computer is not 
loaded.

6. Wait.

7. Type "perl scripts/time-fcs.pl DUMPS/*" and copy-and-paste the results to
the Freecell Solver developers with specifications of your computer that are 
as detailed as possible.
