Pressing
--------

* Create a meaningful man-page from +README.xml+ / +USAGE.xml+ etc.

* Add some command line examples to +USAGE.txt+ .

Non-pressing
------------

* Experiment with making fcs_move_t a bit-field with half-octets/etc. for
the various fields.
** Make sure that the amount required can fit there using CMake and a log2
function.

* Play with moving commonly accessed struct elements to the start of
the struct to fit within the processor's cache line. Like the Linux kernel 
where the most important elements are at the first 32 bytes of the struct.

* See about getting rid of the unused context variable where appropriate.

* Investigate a way to have positions_by_rank also index according to the
suit, and to traverse only the possible parents or children based on the
suit.

* Do the test for +SUSPEND_PROCESS+ (+check_if_limits_exceeded()+ ) in only 
one place. There isn't a need for it to be done in several places.

* Experiment with using a union in the soft_thread to unify common elements
that are used only by one of the scans.

* Move the trunk, branches, tags, etc. to under /fc-solve. (?)

* Re-organize the source code to be more sensibly organized.

* Experiment with using bit members for cards:
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field

* Abstract away the move of a single card from one column to another
in freecell.c.

* Interactive mode? Continue a scan that reached its limit.

* Convert some of the documentation to Perl-POD or DocBook.

* Find a way to update the ChangeLog from the svn.

* Investigate ways to perform more pointer arithematics and 
(ptr < end_ptr) ; ptr++ . A lot of code is under-optimized this way.

* In the states handling, there's still some room for pointer arithmetics.

Long-term
---------

* Code a generic tests grouping.

* Integrate the patsolve's prioritization and mixed BFS/DFS scan.

* Update the architecture document.

* Make a super-strict parsable-output without all the quirks of
-p -t (see Games-Solitaire-Verify for why).

* Write a multi-threaded version.

* Port to Java (?)

* Add a switch to ask the user if he wants to continue and enter a bigger 
iterations limit.

* Check for unmalloced data and if so gracefully exit.

* Experiment with a delta-based state storage.

* Add a way to build the various libavl2 trees to be used as 
positions/columns collections.

* Adapt the scans based on the parameters of the initial board.
+
** Try to find a correlation between various parameters of the initial board 
(such as those calculated in the A* scan or the number of steps required to
sort the cards in each column by rank), and the performance of various scans 
and then:
+
1. Calculate the initial parameters on startup.
+
2. See what would be a good meta-scan based on them.
+
3. Use it.

To be considered
----------------

* Make the code https://sourceforge.net/projects/splint/[splint]-clean.

* Write a multi-process client/server program.

* Add a limit to stacks number (in the case of Indirect Stack States),
number of states that are stored anywhere, etc.
