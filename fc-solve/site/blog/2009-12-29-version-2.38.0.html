<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.38.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is a minor release which makes sure one can build Freecell Solver outside
the source distribution (e.g: <tt>mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake ..</tt>) 
without AsciiDoc, adds a <tt>--pysfolfc</tt> (or an <tt>-F</tt> for short)
flag to make_pysol_freecell_board.py and fixes one of the help displays.
