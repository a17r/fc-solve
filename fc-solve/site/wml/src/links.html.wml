</ul>

<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>

<p class="desc">
Technologies used by Freecell Solver or that aided in its development.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/pfaffben/avl/">libavl</a> - a very nice
library which contains optimized C implementations of an AVL and Red-Black 
binary trees. It's GPLed, which means it can only be used by
certain types of Open-Source software.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/">libredblack</a> - an
ANSI C implementation of a Red-Black tree. Takes some modifications to
compile on Win32. LGPL, so can be used by a code of any license.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">glib</a> - a C library used by gtk+, which 
can also be used separately (as is the case with Freecell Solver). Contains 
implementations of a hash, and an unoptimized balanced binary tree. Both
are slower than libavl/libredblack or the internal hash implmentation, and 
it is less programmer-friendly.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jheyesjones/astar.html">The A* scan</a> -
a states graph scan that uses a priority queue for determining which state
to go to next. This page contains some source code, but the explanation
is also very good.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://dmalloc.com/">The dmalloc malloc debugging library</a> - 
a library to trace memory leaks. Freecell Solver used to have some of those
in various stages of its development, and this library helped to remove
them. It has a rather awkward output, and I had to use a debugger
interactively to complement it, but it is still quite helpful. Now mostly
superceded by <a href="#valgrind">Valgrind</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> - a cross-platform, open-source
build system, which is used by Freecell Solver to portably build
dynamically-linked libraries and facilitate the build process on different
operating systems. It replaced 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU Autoconf, Automake and
Libtool</a>, which predate CMake and have gained popularity lacking any
good competition, but are more error-prone and slow.
</p>
</li>

<li id="valgrind">
<p>
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">Valgrind</a> - a sophisticated 
memory debugger for x86-linux. Helped trace a few hard-to-catch bugs in
Freecell Solver.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim - Vi Improved</a> - an excellent 
cross-platform text editor with many powerful features.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> - an Open-Source
version control management system that has been used in maintaining the
Freecell Solver codebase. It replaced <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> which is older and much more limited.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl</a> - Perl is a sophisticated,
high-level, dynamic programming language. It is often considered a "scripting
language", but can be easily used for writing large-scale and production code.
Perl proved useful for writing a lot of code to automate many tasks in the
development of Freecell Solver. Lately, it was also utilised as the foundation
for its test suite, especially in writing <a href="$(ROOT)/verify-code/">the
solutions' verification code</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB, the GNU Debugger</a> - 
a powerful, cross-platform, scriptable, and open-source command-line 
debugger for binary programs (C, C++, Assembly, etc.). Made debugging and
fixing many hard-to-catch bugs much easier.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> - a lightweight
markup language (with open-source converters) that allows to write plain-text
and convert it to XHTML, to
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook/XML</a>, and subsequently 
to other formats such as PDFs, or UNIX man pages. We use it for
<a href="$(ROOT)/docs/#distributed-docs">the distributed documentation</a>.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
