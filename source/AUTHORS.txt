Freecell Solver's Authors and Contributors List
-----------------------------------------------

* *Shlomi Fish* ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) - doing most of the work on 
Freecell Solver.

* *Eric Warmenhoven* - sending a program that generates the board of GNOME 
Freecell.

* *Hai Huang* - noting several boards of Microsoft Freecell that could not be
solved by Freecell Solver.

* *Magnus Reftel* - noting the correct procedure for calculating how many 
cards can be moved as a function of the free freecells and free stacks.

* *Colin Plumb* - writing the MD5 code.

* *Ron Rivest* - inventing the MD5 hashing algorithm.

* *Jim Horne* - supplying the shuffling algorithm for 
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro.

* *Tom Holroyd* - sending several Seahaven Towers games which Freecell Solver
was unable to solve, thus making me improve the algorithm.

* *Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer* - writing PySol on whose code the board generation
program for it is based. Also, contributing some patches.

* *Justin-Heyes Jones* - wrote a nice introduction to the A* algorithm, and 
wrote the basis for the pqueue.c code.

* *Stephan Kulow* - integrated Freecell Solver into the kpat Solitaire suite for
KDE 2.1 and onwards; reported several bugs and memory leaks.

* *Michael Keller* - Contributing some useful input about some minor features
lacking and the Spades/Clubs mix-up.

* *GeYong* - He created Freecell Tool, whose randomized scan provided 
inspiration for the random-DFS scan of Freecell Solver.

* *Adrian Ettlinger* - Integrating Freecell Solver into "Freecell Pro", and
contributing some input.

* *The perl 5.x Hackers* - I copied its hash function.

* *Gergeley Kontra* - wrote a Vim script to align text which I used.

* *Bob Jenkins* - wrote the lookup2 hash function, which was used as 
the primary hash until reverted back to the perl 5.x hash.
(check http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/)

* *Tzafrir Cohen* - His "RPM" lecture provided help in creating the RPM
+.spec+ file and constructing RPMs (RPM Package Manager) for Freecell
Solver.

* *Yotam Rubin* - Preparing an initial Debian Package.

* *Risko Gergely* - Maintaining the current Debian Package and contributing
some patches to the CMake build system.

* *Chris Moore* - Pointing to an out-of-date comment regarding the 
+MAX_NUM_CARDS_IN_A_STACK+ which I updated.

* *Anonymous* (on http://xrl.us/h6ex ) - for pointing out the malloc.h and 
leading double underscores problems.

* *Con Radchenko* - supplying a small patch, and reporting a bug with
+--method dfs+, and supplying some other input. Integrated Freecell Solver
into http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ .

* *larrysan45* - reporting a problem with +--sequence-move unlimited+
and +--empty-stacks-filled-by kings+, which resulted in a bug fix.

* *Ido Kanner* ( http://ik.homelinux.org/ ) - reporting a segfault when running
freecell-solver-2.28.0 on x86-64, and allowing us to diagnose it. 

* *Gary Campbell* ( http://numin8r.us/ ) - participating in the mailing list
and inspiring some past (and possibly future) work on optimising the
length of the resultant solutions. He was given the honour of naming the
"sand-stone" and "slick-rock" "-l" presets. Has his own solver for
Freecell for DOS on his homepage.

* *LECA Dimitri (Pythack)* ( http://pythack.com/ ) - tried to run the
Freecell Solver test suite and benchmarks on Archlinux, reported some
problems in the process. This in turn eventually made us simplify the process 
and also uncovered some bugs in the dependencies.

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stop_hand_nuvola.svg[The stop sign
that we use on the download page], which is under the Creative Commons
Attribution ShareAlike licence. Thanks!

* David Stevenson - inspiring a documentation clarification for broken
versions of CMake (e.g: cmake-2.6.2).
